# Introduction
## What I have learnt after the Github speedrun ? 
Through the introduction course about github, I was able to see many fucntions the version control software has 
to offer users. Like cloning the github files to your pc to run, commiting and pushing your edits of the file and 
the branches and forks so that these changes don't affect the main. The coolest of all is running git commands 
from the terminal even though I'm still trying to not depend too much on the GUI anymore but it takes time. 

## Who am I ? 
Well unfortunately I am no one (LOL), I'm just an ordinary scholar who is trying everyday to advance my skill and 
kowledge not just in computer science but in other subjects that I love as well.

## What intereset me ? 
Well in computer science it is machine learning and cyber security that I'm interesting. At the moment I do have 
some personal projects regarding the two topics in order to expand my knowledge in this major and probably also
try to  make my resume looks better. In my freetime I often try to get information about other things that intrigued 
me like history, philosophy or astrobiology is very cool.
